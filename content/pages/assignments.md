_Due: Session 9_

1.  **Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird**

Rearrange the poems in "[Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/stevens-13ways.html)" to create two new possible narrative arcs. Write a persuasive explanation of each arc. What aspects of the poem do not change regardless of the ordering of the stanzas? What aspects of the poem absolutely change with the ordering of the stanzas? Where do you think the more substantial meaning of the poem resides—in the aspects that change with reordering, or the aspects that do not?

3.  **Rembrandt**

A striking characteristic of Rembrandt's self-portraits is that a given image often seems incomplete by itself, while also seeming to gesture toward shared features in the larger series. Using specific artworks as examples, describe at least three ways in which Rembrandt creates this effect. As an approach to self-portraiture, how does this differ from a painting like Velázquez' _Las Meninas_ or Vermeer's _The Artist in His Studio_?

5.  **The Disasters of War**

Describe at least three "sub-plots" or subsidiary sequences Goya builds into the _Disasters of War_. For each sequence, provide a careful exegesis. How is Goya using sequence to frame and develop larger social or political arguments?

Final Essay Assignment
----------------------

_Due: Session 25_

Choose a media work of a kind that has not yet been discussed in class. Write a ten-page or twelve-page essay that compares this work with one of the major pieces of work we have studied in class from Tennyson onward.

Instead of 50/50, please split the comparison 60/40 or 70/30—that is, spend 60 percent of the paper on one media work and 40 percent on the other. (This will help you to avoid making the structure of the paper too rote or schematic.) Your argument should include discussion of (1) the new work as a narrative, (2) the new work as a material artifact, and (3) at least two issues relating to the work's seriality that we have **not** yet seen in other works on the syllabus.

Examples of kinds of works you **might** choose include:

1.  A web miniseries
2.  A radio serial (e.g. _The Adventures of Superman_)
3.  A book series written by multiple authors under one name (e.g. _Nancy Drew_ or _The Hardy Boys_)
4.  A newspaper comic strip
5.  A video game series (e.g. _Bioshock_ or _Metal Gear Solid_)
6.  A film franchise that aims to accommodate plot and character development over many years of new installments (e.g. _The Avengers_ Franchise)
